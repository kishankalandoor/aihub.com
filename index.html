	<h1> The Future of Conversational Artificial intelligence Technology</h1>
	<h2>Methodology used:</h2>
	<p>This literature review was conducted using a systematic approach to search and analyze relevant studies on the impact of social media on mental health. A comprehensive search was performed on databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar using relevant keywords. Articles were screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the selected studies were critically evaluated for their quality and relevance to the topic. </p>
	<h2>Remarks:</h2>
	<p>The literature review found that social media use has a complex relationship with mental health. While social media can have positive effects on mental health such as providing social support, it can also have negative effects such as increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness. The findings suggest that excessive social media use and online harassment are particularly harmful to mental health. The review also highlights the need for more research in this area to better understand the relationship between social media and mental health and to develop effective interventions.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
	<p>The literature review concludes that social media has both positive and negative effects on mental health. While social media can be a source of social support, it can also increase feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, particularly with excessive use and online harassment. The findings suggest that individuals should be mindful of their social media use and limit their exposure to harmful content. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between social media and mental health and to develop effective interventions. </p>
